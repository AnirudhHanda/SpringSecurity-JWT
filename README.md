## Key Features

- **User Registration**: Allows new users to register.
- **Password Encoding**: Uses BCrypt for password encoding.
- **Authentication**: Custom `UserDetailsService` for loading user-specific data.
- **Authorization**: Configures HTTP security to restrict access to certain endpoints.
- **JWT Integration**: Implements stateless authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
## Learning Stages

### Stage 1: Project Setup

- **Commit Message**: "Initial project setup with Spring Boot and Maven"
- **Description**: Set up the basic structure of the Spring Boot project with Maven.
-
### Stage 2: Stateless Session and CSRF

- **Commit Message**: "Till learning how to make it all STATELESS and working without CSRF and disabling it with our own SecurityConfig file"
- **Description**: Configured the application to use stateless sessions and disabled CSRF protection.

### Stage 3: HTTP Security Configuration

- **Commit Message**: "The register end-point is made public so that new users do not already need to be authenticated in order to create a new account"
- **Description**: Configured `WebSecurityConfig` to manage session policies, CSRF protection, and endpoint authorization.

### Stage 4: Custom UserDetailsService

- **Commit Message**: "Security concepts learned till logging in the user using DaoAuthenticationProvider, our own UserDetailsService, AppUser, UserPrincipal which is the current user and an implementation of the UserDetails interface"
- **Description**: Implemented `MyUserDetailsService` to load user-specific data during authentication.

### Stage 5: User Registration

- **Commit Message**: "User Registration implemented using BCrypt Password Encoder which is a one-way hashing technique to securely store passwords in the database"
- **Description**: Created `RegistrationController` and `MyUserDetailsService` to handle user registration and save users to the database.

### Stage 6: Password Encoding

- **Commit Message**: "Added BCrypt password encoding"
- **Description**: Integrated BCrypt password encoder to securely store user passwords.

### Stage 7: JWT Integration
- **Commit Message**: "Implemented stateless authentication and authorization using JWT"
- **Description**: Integrated JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to provide stateless authentication and authorization.

## Running the Application

To run the application, use the following command:

    ```sh
